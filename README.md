# Relentless Night V4.40

Relentless Night is a gameplay mod for The Long Dark that introduces a new sandbox scenario where the spin of the Earth is slowing down. Slowly but surely, days and nights are getting longer over time, leading to a world with continuously changing temperatures, weather patterns, wildlife changes, and more.

As the world slows, each longer-dark brings even colder temperatures to the Canadian North, the resulting temperature distributions in the atmosphere start to give way to stronger winds and blizzards, even adapted wildlife slowly start to disappear as they succumb to the worsening conditions of the cold nights.

The player, realizing what is happening, must take advantage of the longer days and the warmer temperatures to prepare for the next even longer, and colder, darkness. All of this eventually leads to the final challenge where all your preparation will really determine how long you survive - The planet finally slows down enough to become tidally locked with the sun, with the survivor now left in the perpetual darkness of the new “dark side of Earth”, and its ever-worsening and frigid conditions.

Relentless Night will add a progress difficulty into survival mode that at first doesn't seem any different than regular run, but the effects will slowly add up and bring about conditions that make gameplay harder. All this eventually leads to a world that's incredibly harsh and difficult to survive in for even veterans and expert survivalists of the game.

What you see above are the classic Relentless Night settings, though you are free to configure your games as you like. All mod settings are dynmaic and can be change during your run. Detailed descriptions of each setting/feature are below:

### How Fast Days And Nights Get Longer

Controls how fast the earth's spin slows down, and so how quickly the duration of days and nights increase

### Perpetual Night Endgame

Enables the Relentless Night endgame where the earth eventually becomes tidally locked with the sun and you are left to survive in perpetual darkness for the rest of the game.

If disabled, the earth's spin will simply keep slowing down forever.

### Endgame Start Day

The endgame will start during the next nightfall after this many days survived, measured in 24 hour days.

### Permanent Aurora At Endgame

The aurora borealis will be present throughout the endgame, ensuring you some light at the new dark side of earth.

### Minimum Air Temperature

The minimum air temperature that will be reached at the endgame or during a sufficiently long night.

### Outdoor Affect On Indoor Temperatures

Controls how much of an effect outdoor temperature will have on indoor temperatures, with a high enough setting no place will be completely safe from the cold.

### Carcass Moving

Add ability to haul medium sized kills such as deer and wolves around the world map, including indoors.

### Electric Torch Lighting

Add ability to light torches using live wires and household outlets during auroras.

### Fire Heat Retention

Fires indoors will keep the building warm for much longer, even after the fire has burnt out. The hotter the fire, the longer it will keep the place warm. Better insulated indoor locations will keep warm for longer.

### Realistic Freezing Damage

For temperatures below a 'feels like' temperature of -40C, the rate at which you suffer freezing damage will be increased.

### Wildlife Final Minimum Population

The wildlife population and respawn rates will decline over time as longer nights make temperatures outside harsher for you and wildlife alike. This setting determines the minimum population that the wildlife population can fall to.

### Day Wildlife Decline Reaches Minimum

Day at which wildlife populations will reach the minimum value set above.

### Fire Fuel Burn Time

Extends how long books, wood, and coal fuels for fires will last after being placed in the fire.

### Lantern Fuel Burn Time

Extends how long lantern fuel will last while in use.

### Torch Burn Time

Extends how long torches will last while in use.
